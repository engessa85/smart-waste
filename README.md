# ♻️ Smart Waste Monitoring and Management System  

## 📌 Overview  
Waste management is a critical challenge faced by modern cities. Most municipalities still depend on fixed waste collection schedules, which often cause:  

- 🚮 Overflowing bins in some areas.  
- 🗑️ Empty pickups in others.  
- ⛽ Unnecessary fuel consumption.  
- 💰 Increased operational costs.  

To solve this, we developed a **Smart Waste Monitoring and Management System** that uses **IoT and cloud technologies** to make waste collection more efficient, cost-effective, and eco-friendly.

## ⚙️ Features  
- 📡 Real-time monitoring of bin fill levels using sensors.  
- 🔗 Data collected with ESP32 microcontrollers.  
- ☁️ Firebase Realtime Database for cloud storage and live updates.  
- 💻 React.js Web Application for visualization and decision-making.  
- 🚛 Optimized collection schedules → reduces costs and saves fuel.  
- 🌍 Promotes cleaner and smarter cities.

## 🛠️ System Architecture  
1. **ESP32 + Sensors** → Detect bin fill level & conditions.  
2. **Firebase Realtime Database** → Store sensor data in the cloud.  
3. **React.js Web App** → Display live bin status for operators.  
4. **Decision-making** → Collect only when necessary.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
- **Hardware**: ESP32, Ultrasonic/Infrared sensors (for bin fill level).  
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database.  
- **Frontend**: React.js + TailwindCSS.  
- **Programming Languages**: C++ (ESP32), JavaScript (React).
